# Recreating Freelancer
---
I wanted to practice my front end web development skills and decided to use an existing Bootstrap theme as a guide. This one is the [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/) theme from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

I refer to the original theme for images and color values, but other than that I'm trying to recreate everything on my own. I'm starting with a mobile first design then will add media queries so it scales well with larger devices.

*__Note:__ As of now, my version is not meant to be a theme that can be installed and used with the Bootstrap framework.*
